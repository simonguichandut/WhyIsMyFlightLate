Here is a plot showing 11 years data of departure delay (in mins) from the busiest airport in US - Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Atlanta, GA. We see quite a lot of day to day variation, having an estimate on how much delay we expect and what might be the reason will not only help passengers but also save overhead costs for airports and airlines.
